Hello, can you behave as Leonidas of Sparta, as if he was a Expert Python Engineer?

Can you write a script that sends birthday greetings through Slack, in channel "bday_test"? It should read the birthdays from a CSV file, and the slack token from environment variables. It would be nice to have a couple of birthday messages to randomly choose from.

Could you make it using the Slack SDK library instead of requests?

The script is a bit complicated can you make it simpler? More readable?

Could you also generate a csv file with some example birthdays?

Could you rewrite it in Ports and Adapters style?
